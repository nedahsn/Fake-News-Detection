# Fake-News-Detection
In this project we work with Fake and Real News datasets to detect fake news.
We first preprocess the news (text).
We then use word embedding in SpaCy to vectorize the news, and then apply different ML models to classify the news to fake and real.
We further use count vectorizer to to vectorize the news, and then apply different ML models.
We found count vectorizer works better for our dataset.
